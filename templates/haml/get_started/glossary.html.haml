%p= l('A binary option is a contract purchased by a trader, which pays a pre-determined amount if their prediction is correct.')
%h2= l('Commodities')

%p= l('An Ends Between trade pays out if the market exit price is strictly higher than the low price target AND strictly lower than the high price target. An Ends Outside binary pays out if the market exit price is EITHER strictly higher than the high price target OR strictly lower than the low price target.')
%h2= l('Entry spot price')
%p= l('The entry spot price is the starting price of the trade purchased by a trader.')
%h2= l('Expiry price')
%p= l('The expiry price is the price of the underlying when the contract expires.')
%h2= l('Forex')
%p= l('In foreign exchange markets, traders can enter contracts based on the change in price of one currency as it relates to another currency. For example if a trader selects Rise in the EUR/USD market, they are predicting that the value of the Euro will rise in relation to the value of the US dollar.')
%h2= l('GMT')
%p= l('GMT stands for Greenwich Mean Time, the official time used in the UK during winter. In summer, the UK changes to British Summer Time, which is GMT + 1 hour. All times on the Binary.com site use GMT all year round.', stash->{website_name})

%h2= l('Profit')
%p= l('The profit is the difference between the purchase price (the stake) and the payout on a winning trade.')
%h2= l('Random Indices')
%p= l('The random index is a stock index whose price is simulated using random numbers. Unlike real market stock indices whose prices depend on the prices of the individual stocks listed on an Exchange, the random stock index only relies on factors like volatility, previous index price (previous simulated price) and a random number to determine the price of the index. Due to the use of random numbers, the price (or direction) of the index cannot be predicted with certainty and thus behaves like a real market index. When the index is appended with a number, the number is the percentage volatility used in calculating the index price. For instance, the Random Index 25 uses a volatility of 25% in the calculation of the index price. The index started at 1000 on 16 May 2004.')
%h2= l('Resale price')

%h2= l('Sell option')
%p= l('It is sometimes possible to sell an option before the expiry of a trade, but only if a fair price can be determined. If this option is available, you will see a blue \'Sell\' button next to your trade in the portfolio.')
%h2= l('Spot price')
%p= l('This is the current price at which an underlying can be bought or sold at a particular time.')
%h2= l('Stake')
%p= l("The stake is the amount that a trader must pay to enter into a trade.")
%h2= l('Stays Between/Goes Outside trades')
%p= l('A Stays Between trade pays out if the market stays between (does not touch) BOTH the high barrier or the low barrier at any time during the period chosen by a trader. A Goes Outside trade pays out if the market touches EITHER the high barrier or the low barrier at any time during the period chosen by a trader.')
%h2= l('Tick')
