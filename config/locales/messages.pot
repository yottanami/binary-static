msgid "\"Binary\" or \"digital\" options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple \"Yes or No\" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option."

Unlike real market stock indices whose prices depend on the prices of the individual stocks listed on an Exchange, the random stock index only relies on factors like volatility, previous index price (previous simulated price) and a random number to determine the price of the index. Due to the use of random numbers, the price (or direction) of the index cannot be predicted with certainty and thus behaves like a real market index. When the index is appended with a number, the number is the percentage volatility used in calculating the index price. For instance, the Random Index 25 uses a volatility of 25% in the calculation of the index price. The index started at 1000 on 16 May 2004."

msgid "Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of your entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved in such transactions. You should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for you in light of your investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. You should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless you understand the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If you are in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for you, please seek independent advice from a investment consulting professional. %1 does not provide such advice. It is your responsibility, taking into account your personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with %1, as well as prior to making any individual order. Where you do not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with %1 or in making any individual order, you should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If you continue to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, you should not trade at all."
